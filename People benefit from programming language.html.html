          <h2> <br /> <u> The Benfits of learning to code: 
        </u> </h2> <br /> 
          <h3> 1. Computer programming promotes logical thinking </h3>
          Coding requires logical thinking and teaches children how to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into smaller
           problems which are easier to manage and solve. This process is called decomposition. 
          <h3>2. Learning to code helps a students’ creativity</h3>
          Coding allows students to be creators. After all, coding is all about creating something new.
           How cool would it be to be able to design your own app or video game? With code, kids can create projects that they love.
            By learning to code students learn to maximize their creativity and learn how to come up with their own ideas in order to solve their problem.
             This is an essential skill that stretches far beyond a computer.
          <h3>3. When students learn to code they develop persistence </h3>
          Perseverance is not an easy trait to teach, especially to a child or student. However, it is an important skill to have in life in general.
           We don’t want children to just give up when they come across a problem or obstacle, we want them to keep going. Coding teaches children persistence,
            that in order to solve the problem they have, they must keep going, coming up with different solutions until they have the right one.
